## Android-MassSmsSender

<b>WARNING:</b>  This software uses the native SMS functionality on your Android device to send multiple SMS messages which will originate from your device's mobile number.  Consideration must be taken as mass
sending of SMS messages from non-bulk registered numbers may result in your mobile number becoming network-blocked and/or reported for SPAM, which could result in loss of service and/or fines or penalties!  

The creators of this test tool assume NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY.

<b>Use at your own risk!</b>
